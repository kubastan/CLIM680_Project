**MJO Propogation in the UFS vs Observations**

The Madden Julian Oscllilation is an area of enhanced convection/precipitation in the tropics that propogates roughly from Eastern Africa to the Central pacific Ocean. This propogation occurs on longer time scales than other atmospheric phenonmeon with a period of anywhere between 30-90 days. Because of this longer time scale the MJO has become a key focus for intraseasonal variability. This phenomenon has a large effect on the atmoshperic response globally and thus can serve a clue to predict weather on the weekly scale. The MJO is considered active when there is an eastward progression of enhanced convection with supressed convection lying in it's wake. This project aims to study how the UFS, an ocean-climate model is able to model this atmospheric cycle.





**Data:**


**1. Observational Data**
Dataset: MSWEP (Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation)
Resolution:
Spatial: 0.1°
Temporal: Daily (04/01/2011 - 04/18/2018)
Variable: Daily Precipitation (mm/day), derived from MSWEP, already processed.

**2. Model Data**
Dataset: UFS Prototype 8 (UFS P8)
Resolution:
Spatial: 0.25°
Temporal: Daily (04/01/2011 - 04/18/2018)
Variable: Precipitation (mm/day), already processed to match the observational data’s temporal scale.

**3. Climate Index**
Dataset: MJO Daily time series (1979- Present)

Description: Projection of 20-96 day filtered ERA5 OLR, including all eastward and westward wave numbers onto the daily spatial EOF patterns of 30-96 day eastward filtered OLR from the ERA5 dataset. EOFs are calculated using data from 1940 to "present".
















Code description: Description of each of your analyses along with a link to your notebook for each analysis. This can be in a bullet or table of contents type format.  














Results: What does your analysis show that is scientifically interesting? What have you discovered?  
Summary: Provide short summary of what you learned from your analysis of your data (both scientific and technical), what you would do next to advance this analysis, and any challenges or issues you encountered/overcame.
