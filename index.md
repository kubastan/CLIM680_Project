Introduction: 

This project will be looking at the propogation of the Madden Julian Osccilation in Observations and in the UFS model. The Madden Julian Oscllilation is an area of enhanced convection/precipitation that propogates from Eastern Africa to the Central pacific Ocean. The Madden Julian Oscillation occurs on time-scales of 30-90 days and thus can be a very important predictor for intraseasonal variability.




Data: A description of your primary dataset and any additional datasets used (e.g. climate indices, comparison datasets).  Should include links or paths to where the datasets are located and some information about the data original source. Should also include any unique information about your data relevant to this class (e.g. data is on an irregular grid).








Code description: Description of each of your analyses along with a link to your notebook for each analysis. This can be in a bullet or table of contents type format.  
Results: What does your analysis show that is scientifically interesting? What have you discovered?  
Summary: Provide short summary of what you learned from your analysis of your data (both scientific and technical), what you would do next to advance this analysis, and any challenges or issues you encountered/overcame.
